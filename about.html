     <div class="reason">
        <p>Not eating healthy and failing to exercise regularly can lead to serious health problems. A poor diet high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats causes weight gain and increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Lack of exercise weakens the heart, muscles, and bones, leading to fatigue and poor body strength. It also affects mental health, contributing to stress, anxiety, and depression, since physical activity helps release feel-good hormones and improves mood. Therefore, people should engage in healthy eating and regular exercise to maintain a strong body, a clear mind, prevent diseases, and live a longer, happier, and more productive life.</p>
