    <h1 class="text-center fw-5 text-success">HOW TO IMPROVE ON YOUR HEALTH</h1>
    <p class="text-center fs-4">Improving your health starts with creating balance in your daily habits — get enough quality sleep each night to allow your body and mind to rest and recover, aim for at least 7–8 hours. Include regular exercise, such as walking, jogging, or strength training, to boost energy, improve heart health, and strengthen your muscles. Equally important is eating balanced, healthy meals rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains while reducing sugar and processed foods. Together, proper sleep, consistent exercise, and nutritious eating build a strong foundation for lasting physical and mental well-being.</p>

      <p class="text-center fs-4">Being healthy is often overlooked, yet it is one of the most valuable assets a person can have. Good health gives you the energy and strength to perform daily tasks efficiently, pursue your goals, and enjoy life fully. Many people focus on wealth, fame, or material possessions, forgetting that without a healthy body and mind, none of these truly matter. Being healthy reduces the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, and improves immunity, mental clarity, mood, and longevity. It also enhances productivity, confidence, and overall quality of life. In today’s fast-paced world, where stress, poor diet, and sedentary lifestyles are common, prioritizing health should be the foundation of everything we do because without it, achieving other life goals becomes much harder.</p>
